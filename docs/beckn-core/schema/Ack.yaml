description: Describes the acknowledgement sent in response to an API call. If the implementation uses HTTP/S, then Ack must be returned in the same session. Every API call to a BPP must be responded to with an Ack whether the BPP intends to respond with a callback or not. This has one property called `status` that indicates the status of the Acknowledgement.

    description: The status of the acknowledgement. If the request passes the validation criteria of the BPP, then this is set to ACK. If a BPP responds with status = `ACK` to a request, it is required to respond with a callback. If the request fails the validation criteria, then this is set to NACK. Additionally, if a BPP does not intend to respond with a callback even after the request meets the validation criteria, it should set this value to `NACK`.
