properties:
  dimensions:
    description: The number of dimensions that are used to describe any point inside that region. The most common dimensionality of a region is 2, that represents an area on a map. There are regions on the map that can be approximated to one-dimensional regions like roads, railway lines, or shipping lines. 3 dimensional regions are rarer, but are gaining popularity as flying drones are being adopted for various fulfillment services. 
    type: string
    enum:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
  type:
    description: The type of region. This is used to specify the granularity of the region represented by this object. Various examples of two-dimensional region types are city, country, state, district, and so on. The network policy should contain a list of all possible region types supported by the network. 
    type: string
  name:
    type: string
    description: Name of the region as specified on the map where that region exists. 
  code:
    type: string
    description: A standard code representing the region. This should be interpreted in the same way by all network participants.
  boundary:
    type: string
    description: A string representing the boundary of the region. One-dimensional regions are represented by polylines. Two-dimensional regions are represented by polygons, and three-dimensional regions can represented by polyhedra. 
  map_url:
    type: string
    description: The url to the map of the region. This can be a globally recognized map or the one specified by the network policy.
