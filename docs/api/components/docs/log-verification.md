    2. Passenger selects a provider and a service. Provider responds with detailed information and quote for the specific service
    3. Passenger proceeds with the details provided and the consumer platform sends the request with respective billing details. Provider platform responds with the updated quote and settlement details
    4. Payment is collected and a confirmation call is made with an order id. The provider provides confirmation of the ride and the driver assigned
    5. The ride is completed and status update is made on the order object

- Flow 4 - quote change after ride
    1. Passenger searches for on demand services available between a start location and an end location. Providers provide their services details
    2. Passenger selects a provider and a service. Provider responds with detailed information and quote for the specific service
    3. Passenger proceeds with the details provided and the consumer platform sends the request with respective billing details. Provider platform responds with the updated quote and settlement details

    5. The service is completed with an update required on the price. The seller app sends the on_update payload with the updated quote object

Logs should be extracted for each of the flows above in this sequence: /search & /on_search, /select & /on_select, /init & /on_init, /confirm & /on_confirm, /status & /on_status (after confirm), /update & /on_update, /status & /on_status;

### Log Verification
To verify your logs, you can use the POST api exposed at [https://log-validation.ondc.org/api/validate/trv/trv10](https://log-validation.ondc.org/api/validate/trv/trv10) within the [Log Validation Utility](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/log-validation-utility).

Available flows are:
- HAPPY_FLOW
- RIDER_CANCEL
- DRIVER_CANCEL
- PRICE_UPDATE

 The payload structure for validation is as follows:

```json
{
    "domain": "ONDC:TRV10",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "flow": "RIDER_CANCEL",
    "payload": {
        "search": {},
        "on_search": {},
        "select": {},
        "on_select": {},
        "init": {},
        "on_init": {},
        "confirm": {},
        "on_confirm": {},
        "status": {},
        "on_status": {},
        "soft_cancel": {},
        "soft_on_cancel": {},
        "cancel": {},
        "on_cancel": {}
    }
}
```

The api call sequence inside the payload object might differ based on different flows
