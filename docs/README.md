## Introduction

Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a network based on beckn open protocol and will enable local commerce across segments, such as mobility, retail etc, to be discovered and engaged by any network-enabled application.

ONDC mobility & travel aims to build a nationwide multi-modal network that provides seamless experiences, supports growth & innovation by,

* bringing together a diverse set of mobility, travel & transportation players who can engage with the open network on their own terms
* fostering collaboration, sharing & new models
* facilitating responsive policy by bringing onboard decision making authorities

In the mobility space, the intent is to enable seamless and truly multimodal transit options by bringing in diverse inventory onboard at scale that will serve the countryâ€™s population.

This would be possible in the mobility domain by making sure all mobility apps in the network are built in such a way as to enable them to communicate with each other in the same language.

## Enabled/Supported use cases on network

* On-demand Ride hailing with fix pick-up and drop locations for transport modes : Car, Autorickshaw, Motorcycle
* Auto assignment of driver on on_confirm.
* Auto assignment of driver post on_confirm.
* Soft/Hard cancellation of ride.
